# Browserbase Proxy Testing Script

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: demonstrate different proxy configurations with Browserbase sessions.

## GLOSSARY

- Proxies: Browserbase's default proxy rotation for enhanced privacy
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/features/proxies

## QUICKSTART

1.  cd proxies-template
2.  uv venv venv
3.  source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4.  pip install -r requirements.txt
5.  pip install browserbase playwright
6.  playwright install chromium
7.  cp .env.example .env # Add your Browserbase API key to .env
8.  python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Tests built-in proxy rotation
- Tests geolocation-specific proxies (New York)
- Tests custom external proxies (commented out by default)
- Displays IP information and geolocation data for each test
- Shows how different proxy configurations affect your apparent location

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Browserbase Developer plan or higher is required to use proxies
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_API_KEY
- Custom proxy errors: verify external proxy server credentials and availability
- Playwright not installed: run `playwright install chromium` after pip install
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## USE CASES

• Geo-testing: Verify location-specific content, pricing, or compliance banners.
• Scraping at scale: Rotate IPs to reduce blocks and increase CAPTCHA success rates.
• Custom routing: Mix built-in and external proxies, or apply domain-based rules for compliance.

## NEXT STEPS

• Add routing rules: Configure domainPattern to direct specific sites through targeted proxies.
• Test multiple geos: Compare responses from different cities/countries and log differences.
• Improve reliability: Add retries and fallbacks to handle proxy errors like ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED.
