# Stagehand + Browserbase: AI-Powered Gift Finder

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: find personalized gift recommendations using AI-generated search queries and intelligent product scoring.
- AI Integration: Stagehand for AI-generated search queries and score products based on recipient profile.
- Concurrent Sessions: runs multiple browser sessions simultaneously to search different queries in parallel.
- Proxies: uses Browserbase proxies with UK geolocation for European website access (Firebox.eu).

## QUICKSTART

1.  cd gift-finder-template
2.  uv venv venv
3.  source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4.  pip install -r requirements.txt
5.  pip install InquirerPy pydantic openai
6.  cp .env.example .env # Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and OpenAI API key to .env
7.  python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Prompts user for recipient and description
- Generates 3 search queries using OpenAI
- Runs concurrent browser sessions to search Firebox.eu
- Extracts product data using structured schemas
- AI-scores products based on recipient profile
- Displays top 3 personalized gift recommendations

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Browserbase Developer plan or higher is required to use proxies (they have been commented out in the code)
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required API keys
- Search failures: check internet connection and website accessibility
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## USE CASES

• Multi-retailer product discovery: Generate smart queries, browse in parallel, and extract structured results across sites (with geo-specific proxies when needed).
• Personalized gifting/recommendations: Score items against a recipient profile for gift lists, concierge shopping, or corporate gifting portals.
• Assortment & market checks: Rapidly sample categories to compare price/availability/ratings across regions or competitors.

## NEXT STEPS

• Add site adapters: Plug in more retailers with per-site extract schemas, result normalization, and de-duplication (canonical URL matching).
• Upgrade ranking: Blend AI scores with signals (price, reviews, shipping, stock), and persist results to JSON/CSV/DB for re-scoring and audits.
• Scale & geo-test: Fan out more concurrent sessions and run a geo matrix via proxies (e.g., UK/EU/US) to compare localized inventory and pricing.
