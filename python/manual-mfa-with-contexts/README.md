# Stagehand + Browserbase: Manual MFA with Contexts

Stagehand is the SDK for browser agents.

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: demonstrate how to persist authentication across sessions using Browserbase Contexts, eliminating MFA friction after the first login.
- Flow: first session creates context and completes MFA manually → context saves auth state → second session reuses context with no MFA required.

## GLOSSARY

- context: a Browserbase feature that persists browser state (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) across sessions.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/features/contexts
- persist: setting that saves authentication state including MFA trust/remember device state to the context.
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): two-factor authentication requiring a code from an authenticator app.
- session persistence: maintaining logged-in state across multiple browser sessions without re-authentication.

## QUICKSTART

1. cd manual-mfa-with-contexts
2. uv venv venv
3. source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4. uvx install stagehand browserbase python-dotenv pydantic requests
5. cp .env.example .env
6. Add your Browserbase API key, GitHub username, and password to .env
7. Ensure 2FA is enabled on your GitHub test account (Settings → Password and authentication → Enable two-factor authentication)
8. python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Creates a new Browserbase context
- First session: navigates to GitHub login, fills credentials, detects MFA prompt
- Pauses and displays Browserbase session link for manual MFA completion
- Waits for MFA completion (2 minute timeout)
- Saves authentication state to context
- Second session: reuses context, navigates to GitHub (already logged in, no MFA)
- Extracts and prints the logged-in username from the reused context
- Cleans up context

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via uvx install
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, GITHUB_USERNAME, and GITHUB_PASSWORD
- MFA timeout: ensure you complete MFA within 2 minutes, or increase timeout value
- 2FA not enabled: GitHub account must have 2FA enabled for this demo to work
- Context not persisting: verify context.persist is set to true in browser_settings

## USE CASES

• Payment automation: Complete MFA once for utility portals, then automate future payments without MFA prompts.
• Account management: Persist authentication for services requiring MFA, enabling automated account management workflows.
• Compliance automation: Store trusted device state for regulatory portals, reducing friction for recurring compliance tasks.

## NEXT STEPS

• Store context IDs: Save context_id per customer in your database to reuse across sessions.
• Multi-portal support: Extend to multiple portals/services, each with their own context.
• Context management: Implement context cleanup, rotation, and expiration policies.
• Error handling: Add retry logic and better error messages for MFA timeouts.
