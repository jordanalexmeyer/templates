# Quickstart: Playwright + Browserbase

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: connect to a cloud browser via Playwright and Browserbase, navigate a real website (SFMOMA), interact with UI elements, and extract page content.
- No AI required: uses Playwright and the Browserbase SDK directly — no model API key needed.
- Minimal setup: one script, one API key, instant cloud browser.

## GLOSSARY

- Session: a full cloud browser instance you connect to via CDP and control with Playwright.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/getting-started
- CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol): the protocol Playwright uses to control the remote browser.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/playwright
- Playwright: browser automation library — `page.goto()`, `page.fill()`, `page.click()`, etc.
  Docs → https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page
- Debug URL: a live view of your session in the Browserbase dashboard.

## QUICKSTART

### Python

1. cd python/playwright/quickstart-playwright
2. cp .env.example .env
3. Add BROWSERBASE_API_KEY to .env (get it from https://browserbase.com/settings)
4. `uv run python main.py`

### TypeScript

1. cd typescript/playwright/quickstart-playwright
2. npm install
3. cp .env.example .env
4. Add BROWSERBASE_API_KEY to .env (get it from https://browserbase.com/settings)
5. npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Creates a Browserbase cloud browser session
- Connects via CDP using Playwright
- Navigates to https://www.sfmoma.org/ and prints the page title
- Opens and closes the search overlay
- Clicks the Membership link and navigates to the membership page
- Extracts the heading and intro text from the membership page
- Closes the browser and prints a session replay link

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Missing API key: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_API_KEY — this is the only required credential
- Project ID confusion: BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID is optional — the API infers it from your API key
- Playwright install: run `playwright install chromium` if you get browser-not-found errors (though Browserbase provides the browser)
- Session not closing: always close the browser to avoid leaked sessions

## USE CASES

- Getting started with Browserbase and Playwright
- Cloud browser automation without managing infrastructure
- Interacting with UI elements and extracting content from web pages
- Building browser-based workflows with Playwright

## NEXT STEPS

- Add AI extraction: swap in Stagehand for AI-powered `act()`, `extract()`, and `observe()`
- Enable proxies: pass `proxies=True` in `bb.sessions.create()` for residential proxy support
- Enable stealth mode: add `browser_settings={"advanced_stealth": True, "solve_captchas": True}` to bypass bot detection
- Run in parallel: create multiple sessions for concurrent browser automation
