# Browserbase Proxy Testing with Playwright

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: demonstrate different proxy configurations with Browserbase sessions using pure Playwright.

## GLOSSARY

- Proxies: Browserbase's default proxy rotation for enhanced privacy
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/features/proxies

## QUICKSTART

1. `cd python/playwright/proxies`
2. `uv sync` (or `pip install .`)
3. `playwright install chromium`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` and `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`
5. `uv run python main.py` (or `python main.py`)

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Tests built-in proxy rotation
- Tests geolocation-specific proxies (New York)
- Tests custom external proxies (commented out by default; requires `CUSTOM_PROXY_SERVER`, `CUSTOM_PROXY_USERNAME`, `CUSTOM_PROXY_PASSWORD`)
- Displays IP information and geolocation data for each test
- Shows how different proxy configurations affect your apparent location

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Browserbase Developer plan or higher is required to use proxies
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via `uv sync` or `pip install .`
- Missing credentials: verify `.env` contains `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
- Custom proxy errors: verify external proxy server credentials and availability
- Playwright not installed: run `playwright install chromium` after pip install

## USE CASES

• Geo-testing: Verify location-specific content, pricing, or compliance banners.
• Scraping at scale: Rotate IPs to reduce blocks and increase CAPTCHA success rates.
• Custom routing: Mix built-in and external proxies, or apply domain-based rules for compliance.

## NEXT STEPS

• Add routing rules: Configure domainPattern to direct specific sites through targeted proxies.
• Test multiple geos: Compare responses from different cities/countries and log differences.
• Improve reliability: Add retries and fallbacks to handle proxy errors like ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED.
