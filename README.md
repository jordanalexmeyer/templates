## Model Gateway

Stagehand primitives use the Browserbase Model Gateway, so they need only `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`. Bring-your-own-agent templates also use Vercel AI Gateway for the outer agent loop and require `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`; no provider-specific OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google key is required.

> **Stagehand V4 note**: V4 does not expose the V3 `agent()` orchestration API. Agent templates use Vercel AI SDK for the loop and Stagehand code mode's `code_execute` MCP tool for browser work; other templates call V4 browser primitives directly.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a template** from the table above
2. **Read the template's README** for specific setup instructions
3. **Set up your environment** with the required API keys and dependencies
4. **Run the template** and start automating

Each template's README contains detailed installation steps, environment variable requirements, and troubleshooting guides.

### TypeScript and generated JavaScript

- **Source of truth:** edit templates under `typescript/`. The `javascript/` tree is generated output, not authored by hand for day-to-day changes.
- **Local only:** run `pnpm run build:javascript` when you want a full mirror of `typescript/` into `javascript/` on your machine (for example to smoke-test the transpiler or compare JS output). There is **no** GitHub Actions workflow that builds the full tree into the repo anymore.
- **Playground releases:** the `production` branch is updated by CI (`.github/workflows/playground-production.yml`), which builds and commits **only** templates that are playground-runnable per the public templates API, then validates them.
