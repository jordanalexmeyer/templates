## Stagehand + Browserbase: Website Link Tester

### AT A GLANCE
- **Goal**: Crawl a website’s homepage, collect all links, and verify that each link loads successfully and matches its link text.
- **Link extraction**: Uses `Stagehand.extract()` with a Zod schema to pull all links and their visible text from the homepage.
- **Content verification**: Opens each link and uses AI to assess whether the page content matches what the link text suggests.
- **Social link handling**: Detects social media domains and only checks that they load (skipping full content verification).
- **Batch processing**: Processes links in batches controlled by `MAX_CONCURRENT_LINKS` (sequential by default, can be made concurrent).

### GLOSSARY
- **extract**: extract structured data from web pages using natural language instructions  
  Docs → `https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract`
- **concurrent sessions**: run multiple browser sessions at the same time for faster batch processing  
  Docs → `https://docs.browserbase.com/guides/concurrency-rate-limits`

### QUICKSTART
1. **cd into the template**
   - `cd typescript/website-link-tester`
2. **Install dependencies**
   - `npm install`
3. **Configure environment**
   - Copy your root `.env.example` to `.env` if needed
   - Add your Browserbase API key and Project ID:
     - `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
     - `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`
4. **Run the script**
   - `npm start`

### EXPECTED OUTPUT
- **Initial setup**
  - Initializes a Stagehand session with Browserbase
  - Prints a live session link for monitoring the browser in real time
- **Link collection**
  - Navigates to the configured `URL` (default: `https://www.browserbase.com`)
  - Extracts all links and their link text from the homepage
  - Logs total link count and unique link count after de-duplication
- **Verification**
  - Verifies links in batches using `MAX_CONCURRENT_LINKS`
  - For each link:
    - Confirms the page loads successfully
    - For non-social links, extracts:
      - `pageTitle`
      - `contentMatches` (boolean)
      - short `assessment` (max ~8 words)
    - For social links, confirms load and skips detailed content checks
- **Final report**
  - Prints a JSON summary including:
    - total links
    - successful vs failed checks
    - per-link details (title, match flag, assessment, and any errors)
  - Always closes browser sessions cleanly

### COMMON PITFALLS
- **Missing credentials**
  - Ensure `.env` contains `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
- **Concurrency limits**
  - `MAX_CONCURRENT_LINKS > 1` will open multiple browsers in parallel and requires a Browserbase plan that supports concurrency (Startup or Developer or higher)
- **Slow or failing pages**
  - Some links may be slow, geo-restricted, or require auth/consent; these can produce timeouts or error messages in the results
- **Dynamic or JS-heavy sites**
  - Heavily scripted pages might take longer to reach `"domcontentloaded"`; adjust timeouts if needed
- **Social / external redirects**
  - Social links and complex redirect chains may succeed in loading but not be fully verifiable for content; these are marked as special cases

### USE CASES
- **Regression testing**: Quickly verify that all key marketing and product links on your homepage still resolve correctly after a deployment.
- **Content QA**: Detect mismatches between link text and destination page content (e.g., wrong page wired to a CTA).
- **SEO and UX audits**: Find broken or misdirected links that can harm search rankings or user experience.
- **Monitoring**: Run this periodically to flag link issues across your marketing site or documentation hub.

### TUNING BATCH SIZE & CONCURRENCY
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_LINKS` in `index.ts`**
  - Default: `1` → sequential link verification (works on all plans)
  - Set to `> 1` → more concurrent link verifications per batch (requires higher Browserbase concurrency limits)
- **Using Semaphores for advanced control**
  - For more fine-grained control over concurrency (e.g., rate limiting, prioritization, or per-domain limits), you can wrap link verification in a **Semaphore** or similar concurrency primitive.
  - This lets you:
    - Cap how many verifications run at once
    - Smooth out spikes in resource usage
    - Apply different limits for external vs internal links if desired

### NEXT STEPS
- **Filter link scopes**: Limit verification to specific path prefixes (e.g., only `/docs` or `/blog`) or exclude certain domains.
- **Recursive crawling**: Start from the homepage, follow internal links to secondary/tertiary pages, and cascade link discovery deeper into the site to build a more complete link map.
- **Alerting & monitoring**: Integrate with Slack, email, or logging tools to notify when links start failing.
- **CI integration**: Run this in CI and fail builds when a critical link (e.g., signup, pricing, docs) breaks.
- **Richer assessments**: Expand the extraction schema to capture additional metadata (e.g., HTTP status code, canonical URL, or key headings).
