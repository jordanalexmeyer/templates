# Stagehand + Browserbase: AI-Powered Gift Finder

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: find personalized gift recommendations using AI-generated search queries and intelligent product scoring.
- AI Integration: OpenAI generates and scores personalized search terms; Stagehand searches and extracts the live products.
- Concurrent Sessions: runs multiple browser sessions simultaneously to search different queries in parallel.

## GLOSSARY

- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (search, click, type)

- extract: pull structured data from pages using schemas

- concurrent sessions: run multiple browser sessions simultaneously for faster searching

- proxies: use geolocation-based routing for European website access (Firebox.eu)

## QUICKSTART

1. cd gift-finder
2. npm install
3. cp .env.example .env
4. Add `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to .env
5. npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Reads the recipient and description from `CONFIG` in `index.ts`
- Generates 3 search queries using OpenAI
- Runs concurrent browser sessions to search Firebox.eu
- Extracts product data using structured schemas
- AI-scores products based on recipient profile
- Displays top 3 personalized gift recommendations

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "Cannot find module": ensure all dependencies are installed
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- Search failures: check internet connection and website accessibility

## USE CASES

• Multi-retailer product discovery: Generate smart queries, browse in parallel, and extract structured results across sites (with geo-specific proxies when needed).
• Personalized gifting/recommendations: Score items against a recipient profile for gift lists, concierge shopping, or corporate gifting portals.
• Assortment & market checks: Rapidly sample categories to compare price/availability/ratings across regions or competitors.

## NEXT STEPS

• Add site adapters: Plug in more retailers with per-site extract schemas, result normalization, and de-duplication (canonical URL matching).
• Upgrade ranking: Blend AI scores with signals (price, reviews, shipping, stock), and persist results to JSON/CSV/DB for re-scoring and audits.
• Scale & geo-test: Fan out more concurrent sessions and run a geo matrix via proxies (e.g., UK/EU/US) to compare localized inventory and pricing.
