# Stagehand + Browserbase: Data Extraction with Structured Schemas

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: show how to extract structured, validated data from websites using Stagehand + Zod.
- Data Extraction: automate navigation, form submission, and structured scraping in one flow.
- Schema Validation: enforce type safety and consistency with Zod schemas.
- Practical Example: verify California real estate license details with a typed output object.

## GLOSSARY

- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (type, click, navigate).
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/act
- extract: pull structured data from web pages into validated objects.
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract
- schema: a Zod definition that enforces data types, optional fields, and validation rules.
  Docs → https://zod.dev/
- form automation: filling and submitting inputs to trigger results before extraction.
- structured scraping: extracting consistent, typed data that can flow into apps, CRMs, or compliance systems.

## QUICKSTART

1.  cd license-verification-template
2.  npm install
3.  cp .env.example .env
4.  Add your Browserbase API key and Project ID to .env
5.  npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Navigates to California DRE license verification website
- Fills in license ID and submits form
- Extracts structured license data using Zod schema
- Returns typed object with license verification details

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "Cannot find module 'dotenv'": ensure pnpm install ran successfully
- Missing API key: verify .env is loaded and file is not committed
- Schema validation errors: ensure extracted data matches Zod schema structure
- Form submission failures: check if website structure has changed

## USE CASES

• License & credential verification: Extract and validate professional license data from regulatory portals.
• Compliance automation: Monitor status changes (active, expired, disciplinary) for risk and regulatory workflows.
• Structured research: Collect validated datasets from government or industry registries for BI or due diligence.

## NEXT STEPS

• Expand schema coverage: Add more fields (disciplinary actions, broker info, historical data) for richer records.
• Scale across sources: Point the same flow at other jurisdictions, databases, or professional directories.
• Persist & integrate: Store structured results in a database or push directly into CRM/compliance systems.
