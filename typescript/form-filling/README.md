# Stagehand + Browserbase: Form Filling Automation

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: showcase how to automate form filling with Stagehand and Browserbase.
- Smart Form Automation: dynamically fill contact forms with variable-driven data.
- Observe → Act: discovers the live form controls once, then fills the observed actions with the matching values.
- Outcome Verification: read every input and dropdown value back from the browser before reporting success.
- Correctness fallback: if V4 cannot execute in the contact form's extension world, uses the form's exact field names and still verifies every value.

## GLOSSARY

- observe / act: discover interactive elements, then execute the observed actions

## QUICKSTART

1. cd form-filling
2. npm install
3. cp .env.example .env
4. Add your Browserbase API key and Project ID to .env
5. npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Initializes Stagehand session with Browserbase
- Navigates to contact form page
- Fills the known form fields and help dropdown with sample data
- Reads every value back to verify the browser retained it
- Closes both the Stagehand instance and browser handle after the workflow
- Closes session cleanly

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "Cannot find module": ensure all dependencies are installed
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required API keys
- Field mismatch: update the stable field-name mapping if the contact form changes
- Network issues: check internet connection and website accessibility

## USE CASES

• Lead & intake automation: Auto-fill contact/quote/request forms from CRM or CSV to speed up inbound/outbound workflows.
• QA & regression testing: Validate form fields, required rules, and error states across releases/environments.
• Bulk registrations & surveys: Programmatically complete repeatable sign-ups or survey passes for pilots and internal ops.

## NEXT STEPS

• Wire in data sources: Load variables from CSV/JSON/CRM and add per-site field mappings.
• Submit & verify: Enable submit, capture success toasts/emails, take screenshots, and retry on validation errors.
• Handle complex widgets: Add file uploads, multi-step flows, dropdown/radio/datepickers, and basic anti-bot tactics (delays/proxies).
