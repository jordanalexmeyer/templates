# Quickstart: Playwright + Browserbase

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: connect to a cloud browser via Playwright and Browserbase, navigate a real website (SFMOMA), interact with UI elements, and extract page content.
- No AI required: uses Playwright and the Browserbase SDK directly — no model API key needed.
- Minimal setup: one script, one API key, instant cloud browser.

## GLOSSARY

- Session: a full cloud browser instance you connect to via CDP and control with Playwright.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/getting-started
- CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol): the protocol Playwright uses to control the remote browser.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/playwright
- Playwright: browser automation library — `page.goto()`, `page.fill()`, `page.click()`, etc.
  Docs → https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page
- Debug URL: a live view of your session in the Browserbase dashboard.

## QUICKSTART

### Option 1: Using create-browser-app (recommended)

1. npx create-browser-app quickstart-playwright
2. cd quickstart-playwright

### Option 2: From this repo

1. cd typescript/playwright/quickstart-playwright
2. npm install

### Then

1. cp .env.example .env
2. Add BROWSERBASE_API_KEY to .env (get it from https://browserbase.com/settings)
3. npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Creates a Browserbase cloud browser session
- Connects via CDP using Playwright
- Navigates to https://www.sfmoma.org/ and prints the page title
- Opens and closes the search overlay
- Clicks the Membership link and navigates to the membership page
- Extracts the heading and intro text from the membership page
- Closes the browser and prints a session replay link

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Missing API key: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_API_KEY — this is the only required credential
- Project ID confusion: BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID is optional — the API infers it from your API key
- Playwright version: use `playwright-core` (not `playwright`) in TypeScript to avoid downloading unnecessary browser binaries — Browserbase provides the browser
- Session not closing: always close the browser to avoid leaked sessions

## USE CASES

- Getting started with Browserbase and Playwright
- Cloud browser automation without managing infrastructure
- Interacting with UI elements and extracting content from web pages
- Building browser-based workflows with Playwright

## NEXT STEPS

- Add AI extraction: swap in Stagehand for AI-powered `act()`, `extract()`, and `observe()`
- Enable proxies: pass `proxies: true` in `bb.sessions.create()` for residential proxy support
- Enable stealth mode: add `browserSettings: { advancedStealth: true, solveCaptchas: true }` to bypass bot detection
- Run in parallel: create multiple sessions for concurrent browser automation
