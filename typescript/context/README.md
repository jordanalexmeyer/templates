# Stagehand + Browserbase: Context Authentication Example

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: demonstrate persistent authentication using Browserbase **contexts** that survive across sessions.
- Flow: create context → log in once → persist cookies/tokens → reuse context in a new session → extract data → clean up.
- Benefits: skip re-auth on subsequent runs, reduce MFA prompts, speed up protected flows, and keep state stable across retries.

## GLOSSARY

- context: a persistent browser state (cookies, localStorage, cache) stored server-side and reusable by new sessions.
  Docs → https://docs.browserbase.com/features/contexts
- persist: when true, any state changes during a session are written back to the context for future reuse.
- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (click, type, navigate).

## QUICKSTART

1.  cd context-template
2.  npm install
3.  npm install axios
4.  cp .env.example .env
5.  Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and SF Rec Park credentials to .env
6.  npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Creates context, performs login, saves auth state
- Reuses context in new session to access authenticated pages
- Extracts user data using structured schemas
- Cleans up context after completion

## COMMON PITFALLS

- "Cannot find module": ensure all dependencies are installed
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required variables
- Context persistence: ensure persist: true is set to save login state

## USE CASES

• Persistent login sessions: Automate workflows that require authentication without re-logging in every run.
• Access to gated content: Crawl or extract data from behind login walls (e.g., booking portals, dashboards, intranets).
• Multi-step workflows: Maintain cookies/tokens across different automation steps or scheduled jobs.

## NEXT STEPS

• Extend to multiple apps: Reuse the same context across different authenticated websites within one session.
• Add session validation: Extract and verify account info (e.g., username, profile details) to confirm successful auth.
• Secure lifecycle: Rotate, refresh, and delete contexts programmatically to enforce security policies.
