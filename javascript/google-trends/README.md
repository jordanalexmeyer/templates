# Stagehand + Browserbase: Google Trends Keywords Extractor

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: Extract trending search keywords from Google Trends for any country with structured JSON output.
- Configurable by country code (US, GB, IN, DE, etc.) and language preference.
- Uses Zod schema validation for consistent, typed data extraction.

## QUICKSTART

1. pnpm install
2. cp .env.example .env
3. Add required API keys/IDs to .env
4. pnpm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Initializes Stagehand session with Browserbase
- Displays live session link for monitoring
- Navigates to Google Trends trending page with configured country/language
- Dismisses any consent dialogs if present
- Extracts trending keywords with rank positions
- Outputs structured JSON with country code, language, timestamp, and keyword list
- Closes session cleanly

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID, BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, and GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Invalid country code: ensure country code is a valid 2-letter ISO code (US, GB, IN, DE, FR, BR, etc.)
- Empty results: Google Trends may not have trending data for all country/language combinations
- Consent dialogs: script handles "Got it" dialogs automatically, but regional variations may require adjustment

## NEXT STEPS

• Parameterize inputs: Accept country code and limit as command-line arguments or environment variables for flexible deployment.
